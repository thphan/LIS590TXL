103@6@"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together."

118@4@How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!
131@4@Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father"s neck.

17@4@Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,
18@4@"No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow!
19@4@We"ll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!"
21@7@Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side.
27@4@"Well," said the shepherd, "if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself."
29@4@"What a noble heart that good man has!" thought he.
31@4@Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.
32@4@"If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?"
39@7@While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless.
51@4@"Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!" said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.
52@4@So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.
55@4@The countryman stopped to ask what was o"clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him.
74@4@Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.
75@4@"After all," thought he, "that chap is pretty well taken in.
80@4@How happy my mother will be!
81@4@Talk of a pig, indeed!
82@4@Give me a fine fat goose."
84@4@"O"er hill and o"er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?"
85@4@Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, "You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work."
86@4@"Yes," said the other, "mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?"
102@4@"How can you ask?" said Hans; "I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there"s the goose."
104@4@Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, "Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.
105@4@People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains."
108@7@So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.
110@4@"How happy am I!" cried he; "nobody was ever so lucky as I."
111@4@Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother"s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.

26@3@The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: "Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!"
32@6@Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.
42@3@"Nothing nothing," he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it.
54@3@You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was!
90@3@The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army.

61@3@All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.

7@4@"A lucky hit!" said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.
12@3@Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, "It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog."
22@4@And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him.
23@4@The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time.
26@4@Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since.
27@4@But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.
29@3@But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years.
34@6@This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.
37@6@"Now," thought she to herself, "no aid of man can be of use to me."

65@4@And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood.
69@4@Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife"s voice, and sprang up, and said, "You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour."
