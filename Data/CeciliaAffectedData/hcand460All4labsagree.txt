26@4@It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.
28@4@The flower entwined itself even in his dreams- for him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume.
29@4@And it gladdened his eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord called him.
31@6@During that time the flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of the lodgers' removal.
35@4@Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.
38@4@Then it joined in the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and others in a distant circle, but all equally happy.
39@4@They all joined in the chorus of praise, both great and small,- the good, happy child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.

5@6@Then he would cry, but what nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired, and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst.
44@4@Her beautiful, noble child had been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he had loved her so much, and she had loved him in return; they had kissed and loved each other, and the boy had been her joy, her second life.
61@6@Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her.
71@6@She felt very low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him.
111@3@Only tangled grass, and yet she was frightened at it.
116@3@As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster.
117@3@Fear came upon her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that she almost fainted.
143@3@It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish and horror.
144@3@Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn with the heat of fever.
156@3@"A grave! dig me a grave!" still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would be lost.
178@4@"Now I am in the house of God," she said, "and in that house we are happy."
apple_br.agree
21@7@"A difference!" cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the blooming apple-branch, and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the fields.
31@4@There came presently across the fields a whole group of children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed them in childlike innocence.
a_story.agree
6@2@But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly and angrily.
8@2@He spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.
11@3@It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.
72@2@And the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the face.
78@3@The pastor's hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner's head.
beauty.agree
26@4@Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors in Italian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean, the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which also was charming.
50@4@The young man felt the truth of the proverb, "Still waters run deep:" and his heart had sunk into their depths.
55@7@"Good heavens!" she exclaimed.
61@7@He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had been over-powered with the appearance of the colored plates, threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment, "What, did you see it throw up white fire?"
66@4@The betrothed pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too.
102@2@"There is no real pleasure in travelling," said mamma; "to tell the truth, it's very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so.
103@2@I was soon very tired of it, although I had my children with me; and, besides, it's very expensive work travelling, very expensive.
104@2@And all those galleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you are obliged to run after!
105@2@It must be done, for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all.
106@2@I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas; I began to think I was turning into a Madonna myself."
108@2@"Yes, indeed," she replied, "no such a thing as a respectable meat soup- their cookery is miserable stuff."
117@6@Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning.
119@6@She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred marry again, marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at.
120@2@"He's gone to the very extreme," said mamma-in-law; "he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife.
123@4@"'Pygmalion loved his Galatea,' was in the song they sung at my first wedding," said Alfred; "I once fell in love with a beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with and elevate us, I have not found and won till now.

62@4@What happiness for a mother!"
65@4@How charming this is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.
75@4@"Certainly," said the beetle, "I shall be most happy; I have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; I have also pains in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of broken crockery.
85@4@The mother gave them her blessing, and all the other beetles cried "hurrah."
94@2@"Fie on the villain that forsook her!"
109@4@"What a wonderful quantity of plants," cried the beetle; "how good they will taste when they are decayed!
129@2@"You speak without knowing the facts," replied the beetle; "don't you see that I am a prisoner?"
134@2@This vexes me more than anything.

bottle_n.agree
46@4@"Safe return, and a wedding this day next year," he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, "Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!"
65@4@Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark," "Peter Jensen's lark."
100@4@For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.
101@4@"There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar."
123@4@The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.
143@4@Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.
buckwhet.agree
12@2@But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, "Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."
17@3@"Bend your head as we do," cried the ears of corn; "the angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above to the earth beneath.

28@6@The branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping.
butterfl.agree
15@2@But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference.
25@4@The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.
29@7@"Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day," said he; and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.
37@4@"I will take her," said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.
54@6@"It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast."

child_in.agree
2@6@The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow.
3@6@The father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief.
6@6@She thought God could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, "God does not know it.
10@6@But these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair.
12@6@The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.
15@6@When she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, "We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so."
16@6@"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?" she said with groans and tears.
21@6@With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?
32@6@As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.
cock.agree
20@2@All this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all were stale and small-minded.
21@2@"The world is no good!" he said.
22@2@"Everything in it is so stupid."
39@2@"Everything is very stupid," the weather-cock said to himself.
42@2@Everything is so stupid!

daisy.agree
9@4@How rich I am!"
17@4@Its joy was so great that it did not know what to think.
18@4@The little bird hopped round it and sang, "How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here."
20@4@How happy the daisy was!
30@7@"Ugh!" sighed the daisy, "that is terrible; now they are done for."
35@6@Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.
37@6@The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.
48@6@The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.
59@6@Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."
62@6@The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "Tweet, tweet," was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.
63@6@The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully.
64@6@The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.
darning.agree
11@4@And there she sat as proudly as if she were in a state coach, and looked all around her.

13@4@"Thus the small service done to the old man was richly rewarded!" said Meta Mogen.
19@4@In the garden grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal, she beams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done in the wide world, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is not forgotten.
25@4@The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the wood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful, and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion.
26@4@"The word was so easy, the deed so small," she said, "the joy it afforded me was infinitely great and sweet!"
43@6@A week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper, that is the reason of the girl's mourning!
45@6@The black bow signifies mourning, the girl's face points to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and will never be forgotten.

57@2@Then the Princess would say, "He is of no use!
58@2@Away with him out of the hall!"
66@2@"He is of no use!" said the Princess.
67@2@"Away with him!"
73@2@"Away with him!"
78@4@"Ah, that's lucky!" exclaimed Jack the Dullard, "for I suppose you'll let me roast my crow at the same time?"
79@4@"With the greatest pleasure," said the Princess.
87@4@"I like that!" said the Princess.
91@4@But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a blot out of his pen on to the floor.
dumbbook.agree
7@6@"They say that he was once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages, and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink, body and mind.
10@6@But when we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.
elfin_hi.agree
1@2@"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."
56@2@"Feet off the table-cloth!" said the old goblin.
68@2@"Stop!" cried the old goblin," is that the only house-keeping they can perform?
83@7@"Ho! ho!" said the old goblin, "is that what she means?
91@4@So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal.

elf_rose.agree

43@6@Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.
49@6@Oh, how she wept and prayed that she also might die!
58@6@Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found her weeping by the flower pot.
59@6@The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher.
emperor.agree
19@7@"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.
30@4@"We are pleased to hear that," said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.
81@7@"Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child," said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said.
fir_tree.agree
0@6@FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it.
51@6@As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.
59@3@How the fir-tree trembled!
71@4@It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.
72@7@"Help! help!" exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire.
75@4@For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.
125@4@And then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree.
138@4@"Now life is beginning again," said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.
152@6@The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.

12@4@I am the happiest of all creatures."
13@7@Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking.
21@4@"Well, this is quite wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune.
25@4@How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the world- so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length!

195@7@"There goes one!" cried he.
238@3@He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again.
268@7@He started back, quite bewildered with the fright which the goloshes of Fortune had caused him.
297@7@"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."

378@4@As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, "I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.
451@3@The canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, "Let us be men;" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place.

30@4@He will be the joy of our home; and we old folks have nothing else to live for.
33@2@"There may be black snails, no doubt," said the old snail; "black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited too.

111@4@His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: "Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.
114@4@I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.
125@6@At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."
140@6@Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive.
172@6@At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.
194@6@Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.

18@4@And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.
19@4@The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment.
24@4@The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.
53@4@Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.
55@4@Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches.
57@4@As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.
62@6@The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him.

113@6@She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again.
131@2@Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.

55@4@The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."

56@4@"Oh how funny!" said Ida, and she laughed.
58@2@He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures.
61@2@But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had just said, "How can anyone put such nonsense into a child's head! what absurd fancies there are!"
66@2@So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.
92@4@They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.
96@2@All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, "How can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.
97@4@This was very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing.

28@6@"Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.
29@6@She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.
31@6@As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.
36@4@Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.
40@3@Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree!
50@6@Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.
58@6@She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.
68@4@She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, "You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much."
69@4@And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.
86@6@It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.
98@7@Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went "thump, thump."
101@3@Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.
110@4@The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.
117@6@Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.
119@6@"Tweet, tweet," sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.
132@6@But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.
136@6@Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.
143@6@The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.
149@4@As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.

29@4@One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
38@4@The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
56@3@Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
80@6@Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
82@6@Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
91@4@A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
93@6@He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
98@4@So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.

77@7@All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
78@3@Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
98@2@Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
99@2@There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.

64@4@The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.
98@4@So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.
107@6@Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.

126@2@Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
137@6@Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.

99@4@Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
121@4@The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
129@4@"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."

50@6@Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.
142@6@Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
189@6@I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!

53@4@However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.
54@4@Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.
86@7@"And here is one, and there is another!" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.
100@4@The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.
113@4@The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.
tin_sold.agree
65@4@It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.
top_ball.agree
1@2@But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.
24@6@"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."
45@7@"Ah," she exclaimed, "here is a gilt top."

29@7@The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.
55@6@"He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
62@6@Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
77@3@How they terrified the poor duckling!
91@4@She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
105@6@So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
130@6@All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
132@7@The duckling had never seen any like them before.
137@4@Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.
146@3@The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
147@3@Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.
159@6@The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.
167@4@He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
169@4@"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."
175@4@Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."

13@2@At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: "Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God's power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders."
29@2@They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
33@2@Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.
