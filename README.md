<h2 align="center">Emotion detection from text using different supervised learning approaches
</h2>

<p>With the rapid growth of Internet, people now not only communicate with each other by speech but also interact in textual form. The large collections of documents/texts can provide various knowledge and information and many fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Affective Computing have a keen interest in these collections of texts. And one of the growing areas of interest for textual analysis is the detection of emotion. Emotion detection has a great application in different domains such as e-mail (Mohammad and Yang, 2011), suicide prevention [Desmet, 2013], microblog [Roberts, 2012] by analyzing users’ emotion through his/her text (Eg: Tweet, blog, notes) to understand their feelings about particular topics, programs, services, products or even their characteristics.
</p>
<p>Emotion detection has been implemented in various studies using different machine learning approaches including both supervised and unsupervised learning. Those studies inspire me to find out which is the best and most appropriate approach for us to detect emotions in text. 
</p>
<p>Hence, in the final project, I would like to examine different methods of supervised learning classification on several datasets to find out the most plausible method for emotion detection.</p>

#### My project aims to answer two questions:
- Compare the emotion classification performance over 3 different datasets of different topics (fairy tale stories, news/headlines and people responses over various situations), using different supervised methods including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree. Which method gives the best performance over all datasets?
Can Dimensionality Reduction (SVD) help in improving the classification results before applying classifier?
- Also an extra experiment I would like to implement in the project is to find out the emotions expressed in the stories people posted on Human of New York using the best classification I get from my comparison.
